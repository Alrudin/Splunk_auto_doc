Date: 2025-09-28 (status update: 2025-10-04)
Author: @Alrudin (compiled with Copilot assistant)

## Purpose
This document captures the comparison between the Milestone 1 execution plan (notes/milestone-1-plan.md) and the currently tracked work in GitHub issues/PRs, and enumerates recommended new issues to complete the milestone.

## Source Inputs
- Milestone plan: `notes/milestone-1-plan.md`
- Current M1-scoped items closed as of 2025-10-04:
  - Infrastructure: Issue #8; PRs #9, #10
  - Backend skeleton: Issue #11; PR #13
  - DB schema & migration: Issue #14; PR #15
  - Storage abstraction: Issue #16; PR #17
  - Upload ingestion endpoint: Issue #18; PR #19
  - Runs listing & detail endpoints: Issue #20; PR #21
  - Logging & request middleware: Issue #22; PR #23

## High-Level Summary (Updated 2025-10-04)
Core backend deliverables for M1 are completed: infrastructure, backend skeleton, initial database schema, storage abstraction, upload ingestion, runs endpoints, and structured logging middleware. Remaining gaps primarily involve frontend scaffolding/pages, comprehensive testing, documentation/ADR polish, CI hardening, and risk mitigations (streamed uploads and DB readiness beyond basic health checks).
