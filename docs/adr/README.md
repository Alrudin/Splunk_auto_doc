# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Splunk Auto Doc project. ADRs document significant architectural and technical decisions made during the project's evolution.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

- **Context**: The problem or opportunity that triggered the decision
- **Decision**: The choice that was made
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-core-stack.md) | Core Technology Stack Selection | Accepted | 2025-01-XX |

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
- **Rejected**: Proposed decision was not accepted

## Creating a New ADR

When making a significant architectural decision:

1. Copy the template (if one exists) or use ADR-001 as a reference
2. Number the ADR sequentially (ADR-002, ADR-003, etc.)
3. Include:
   - **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, etc.
   - **Context**: Why is this decision needed?
   - **Decision Drivers**: What factors influence the decision?
   - **Considered Options**: What alternatives were evaluated?
   - **Decision Outcome**: What was chosen and why?
   - **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?
   - **References**: Links to related documents and resources
4. Update this index with the new ADR
5. Reference the ADR in related documentation (README, milestone plans, etc.)

## Format

ADRs use Markdown format and follow this general structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

**Status:** Proposed/Accepted/Superseded/Deprecated/Rejected
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision Makers:** @username1, @username2
**Related Documents:** Links to relevant docs
